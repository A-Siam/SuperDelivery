# Super delivery application
super delivery provide creating order -> update inventory -> process payment -> deliver order

## Patterns Used
- Saga pattern
- Event sourcing
- CQRS

**Note** This project *intentionally* doesn't use any external frameworks to deeply learn about the topics mentioned however for production grade application I would use something like **AxonIQ** framework to handle these patterns for me. Also auth is neglected in this application for simplicity
